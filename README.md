# Reproducibility Case Study

Thank you for your interest in our reproducibility case study project. The  goal of this project is to better understand and communicate existing practices surrounding reproducibility in academic research. Our strategy is to gather a collection of case studies, authored by individual researchers from across disciplines who volunteer to share their practices. Each case study will provide a single, concrete example of a workflow pipeline that embodies the principles of reproducible research. We do not intend to create another anecdotally-derived list of best practices or a discussion of the _why_ of reproducibility, but rather to gather and share examples of the _how_ of reproducibility practices in academia.

Our first collection of 31 case studies have been collected and will soon be published as a book, *The Practice of Reproducible Research*, which is forthcoming from the University of California Press. Although you are welcome to read and review these case studies in the `case-studies` directory of this repository, we ask that you please not advertise or disseminate any of the materials in this repo until the formal launch of our book project.

Beyond this first book, we are continuing to collect additional case studies for a "Volume 2" that will be published online and possibly also in print at a future date. We welcome contributions of reproducibility case studies from all disciplines, and particularly invite contributions from researchers in the social sciences and humanities.

If you would like to submit a case study for this second volume, please see the [instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md).

Please contact Justin Kitzes (jkitzes@berkeley.edu) with any questions.
