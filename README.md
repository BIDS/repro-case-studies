Reproducibility Case Study
==========================

##### Introduction

Thank you for volunteering to contribute to our reproducibility case study project.

The overall goal of this project is to better understand and communicate existing practices surrounding reproducibility in academic research. Our strategy is to gather a collection of several dozen case studies, authored by individual researchers from across disciplines who volunteer to share their practices. Each case study will provide a single, concrete example of a workflow pipeline that embodies the principles of reproducible research. We do not intend to create another anecdotally-derived list of best practices or a discussion of the _why_ of reproducibility, but rather to gather and share examples of the _how_ of reproducibility practices in academia.

<!-- A case study takes the form of a ~1,500-2,000 word response to a series of short answer quetsions and a flowchart-style diagram, both described in detail below. The initial group of authors reported that a case study took approximately 2-4 hours to prepare. -->

As you prepare your case study, consider your audience to be advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and other disciplinary scientists who want to learn the "how" of reproducible research by example. We will work to publish these case studies as an edited volume, where you will be credited as a chapter author for your case study, and in a Github repo or other similar open online platform.

##### What is a case study?

A case study describes the computational workflow that you used to complete a single well-defined research output (e.g., a manuscript or equivalent). A case study specifically should not describe a lab, a person, a concept, or a general hardware/software stack. It should be an example of a concrete research activity, not a reflection. The goal is to capture your web of practices surrounding a specific research pipeline and its associated benefits and challenges.

Broadly, there are two types of topics that may be the subject of case studies. The first is a manuscript or equivalent "traditional" publication. The second is a piece of software that you have developed as part of your research. In both cases, the case study should describe the workflow used to create the final product. Examples of both types of case studies are attached with this document.

When choosing a subject for your case study, __think small and concrete__. For a sense of scale, a case study should cover research that took approximately 6 months to 1 year of work for a single researcher. If your projects tend to be large or complex, you may choose to focus on only a portion of a larger project for your case study. If you do not have a single project that you feel would be useful to share, you can describe an "idealized" workflow that combines features of several different real projects, although we are particularly interested in hearing about projects that were partially successful or that involved significant difficulties.

##### Case study format

To complete your case study, please use the attached Markdown template, which will guide you through a series of standard short answer questions. Length suggestions are provided for each question. You may also wish to refer to the two attached sample case studies for guidance.

In summary, the core of the case study is a visual diagram showing your workflow with an accompanying narrative description. You'll also be asked for additional detail on specific pain points (portions of the reproducible workflow that were failed, incomplete, or particularly challenging), key achievements, and key tools. Several general questions on your views of reproducibility will complete the case study.

Each case study will be short, with a target of ~1500-2000 words (~6-9 pages) for the final version. We encourage you to write more than this if needed in your initial submission, recognizing that the editors will later help you to to reduce this total.

##### Submitting your case study

When completed, please submit your case study as a pull request to the BIDS reproducibility case study Github repo (http://github.com/BIDS/repro_case_study). To do this, first clone the repository, then place your completed case study template and your diagram in the *case_studies* subdirectory, naming each file with your first initial followed by your last name. Then submit a pull request for your contribution.

Alternatively, you may email your contribution to Justin Kitzes (jkitzes@berkeley.edu). Please feel free to contact Justin with any questions on submission, the case study, or the larger project.
