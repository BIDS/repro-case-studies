# Reproducibility Case Study

Thank you to those who have contributed case studies to our collection. The case studies will be published as part of book, *The Practice of Reproducible Research*, which is forthcoming from the University of California Press.

For those who have stumbled across this repository, we ask that you please not advertise or disseminate any of the materials in this repo. We will have a formal launch for these case studies when they have been revised, edited, and collated.

Please contact Justin Kitzes (jkitzes@berkeley.edu) with any questions.
