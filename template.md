##### Introduction
*Please answer these introductory questions for your case study in a few sentences.*

1) Who are you and what is your research field? Include your name, affiliation, discipline, and the background or context of your overall research that is necessary specifically to introduce your specific case study.

[Answer]

2) Define what the term "reproducibility" means to you generally and/or in the particular context of your case study.

[Answer]

##### Workflow diagram

The core of your case study is a visual diagram, and associated textual narrative, describing the workflow for your case study.

Begin by creating a diagrammatic sketch, which you are welcome to do by hand, that shows your workflow pipeline visually. If you would like to do this digitally, we recommend the site draw.io.

Think of this like a circuit diagram for your workflow. Boxes should represent individual steps in the process, with arrows showing how the inputs and outputs of each step relate to each other. Be sure to consider

* specialized tools and where they enter your workflow

* the "state" of the data at each stage

* collaborators

* version control repos

* products produced at various stages (graphics, summaries, etc)

* databases

* whitepapers

* customers (if any)

There are two examples diagrams attached with this template for reference.

Please save your diagram alongside this completed case study template.

##### Workflow narrative

Referring to your diagram, describe your workflow for this specific project, from soup to nuts. Imagine walking a friend or a colleague through the basic steps, paying particular attention to links between steps. Write this description in text. Don't forget to include "messy parts", loops, aborted efforts, and failures.

It may be helpful to consider the following questions, where interesting, applicable, and non-obvious from context.

* For each part of that workflow:

    * How often does this step in the workflow happen?

    * How long does it take?

    * Which members of your team participate (or not)?

    * How much human intervention is involved?

        * Is that human intervention recorded in some way?

    * How much is scripted or otherwise automated?

        * What records are kept about this automation process?

    * Which software or online tools do you rely on?

        * What are its key important uses and limitations?

        * Does it make you more efficient or slow you down?

        * Does this tool affect your ability to reproduce your results?

        * Have you previously tried any other tools for this task?

        * Are you aware of tools that might make this step more efficient? If so, why have those tools not made it into your workflow?

    * How opaque is this step to a researcher external to your research group?

        * Is the necessary code online?

            * How is the documentation?

            * Are there tests?

            * Do you keep example input files alongside your code?

        * Is your raw data online?

            * Is it citeable?

            * Does the license allow external researchers to publish a replication/confirmation of your published work?

        * Is your data processing workflow online?

            * Are the scripts documented?

            * Would an external researcher know what order to run them in?

            * Would they know what parameters to use?

##### Pain points
*Describe in detail the steps of a reproducible workflow which you consider to be particularly painful. How do you handle these? How do you avoid them?*

[Answer, 200-400 words]

##### Key benefits
*Discuss one or several sections of your workflow that you feel makes your approach better than the "normal" non-reproducible workflow that others might use in your field. What does your workflow do better than the one used by your lesser-skilled colleagues and students, and why? What would you want them to learn from your example?*

[Answer, 200-400 words]

##### Key tools [Optional]
*If applicable, provide a detailed description of a particular specialized tool that plays a key role in making your workflow reproducible, if you think that the tool might be of broader interest or relevance to a general audience.*

[Answer, 200-400 words]

##### General questions about reproducibility [Optional]

*Please provide short answers (a few sentences each) to these general questions about reproducibility and scientific research. Rough ideas are appropriate here, as these will not be published with the case study. Please feel free to answer all or only some of these questions.*

1) Why do you think that reproducibility in your domain is important?

[Answer]

2) How or where did you learn the reproducible practices described in your case study? Mentors, classes, workshops, etc.

[Answer]

3) What do you see as the major pitfalls to doing reproducible research in your domain, and do you have any suggestions for working around these? Examples could include legal, logistical, human, or technical challenges.

[Answer]

4) What do you view as the major incentives for doing reproducible research?

[Answer]

5) Are there any broad reproducibility best practices that you'd recommend for researchers in your field?

[Answer]

6) Would you recommend any specific websites, training courses, or books for learning more about reproducibility?

[Answer]
